This binary can execute the model on mobile and also export the model output that we can retrieve later. The binary is available [here](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/blob/master/caffe2/binaries/speed_benchmark.cc). In order to build the binary, execute the `build_android.sh` script following the instructions [here](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/blob/master/scripts/build_android.sh). \n",
