    "`onnx_chainer` provides `export` function that takes a Chainer model and its expected arguments given to `__call__` method of the model. It executes a forward pass once with the given model object and arguments to construct a computational graph. Because Chainer is the first deep learning framework that proposed Define-by-Run approach, the computational graph for backward computation is constructed on-the-fly. `onnx-chainer` is a trace-based exporter, so it needs to run a model once before converting the structure into ONNX.\n",
