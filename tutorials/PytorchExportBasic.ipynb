    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The ONNX exporter is a trace-based exporter, which means that it operates by executing your model once, and exporting the operators which were actually run during this run. This means that if your model is dynamic, e.g., changes behavior depending on input data, the export won’t be accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a trace is might be valid only for a specific input size (which is one reason why we require explicit inputs on tracing). Most of the operators export size-agnostic versions and should work on different batch sizes or input sizes. We recommend examining the model trace and making sure the traced operators look reasonable."
